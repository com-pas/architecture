## High Level CoMPAS Requirements

This page presents the high level requirements for the CoMPAS project.
Together with the Technical Architecture, it should be possible to make the correct technology choices related to the requirements.

### System configuration
 - CoMPAS must provide “System Specification Description (SSD)” to “Substation Configuration Description (SCD)” conversion
 - PACS policy registry 
 - API to vendor specific IED configurators
 - Provenance (e.g. by using W3c PROV and/or SCL history)
 - CoMPAS must provide an Audit trail

### IEC61850 profile management
 - logical device/function builder
 - library of common profiles for usual functions
 - versioning of IEC-61850 formats, like ICDs, SCL's and NSD's.
 - definition of reusable user profile of IEC 61850 data model (potentially continue/restart ENTSO-E profiling tool)

### IEC-61850 SCL verification
 - Conformity verification of System Configuration description Language (SCL) files

### System specitifcation
 - profile to “System Specification Description (SSD)” conversion
 - PACS policy registry (scripts?)
 - API to vendor specific “IED Capability Description (ICD)” tools (not in direct scope, Nice To)
 - ICD/SCD conformity check
 - ICD/SCD compatibility management
 - ICD/SCD versioning / repository

### PACS Availability
 - Availability of Substation PACS data at enterprise level (Functions & settings, operational process data)

### Mapping functions between CIM and IEC 61850
 - Convert a CIM single line diagram into IEC61850 SLD

### Compare functions
 - Compare configurations (ICDs for example)

### Security requirements
- Docker images must be signed
- At the stage of CI/CD the code integrity must be validated
- Data regarding substation configuration must be regarded as confidential. Data stored, processed or in transit must be protected against data disclosure and tampering.
- Configuration files could be signed

### Non-functional Requirements

 - A User Manual must be provided, including Javadocs
 - System Documentation must be provided
 - How do we handle event failures?
 - Response times (output)
 - Processing times (input)
 - Timeouts for processing
 - Access levels / Role based access
 - Access permissions for certain application parts
 - Scalability of the application (use case: size of the SCL files)
 - How to handle log files (rotating?)
 - Deployment models
 - Cross platform compatibility
 
 ## 61850 Requirements
Requirements based on IEC 61850-6 10.2 System configurator

The SSD describes the one-line diagram and the automation functions
  -	Essential - make corrections = CRUD operations on any item, or sets of items, preserving referential integrity
  -	Nice to have :  visualize this on a diagram  = requires extensions for graphics plus pan/zoom/layering features


The SSD will describe the communications devices
  -	 Essential – import ICD, CID, IID files of various versions and compile composite DataTypeTemplates for the client(s)
  -	 Delete devices and all associated relationships
  -	 Edit IP addresses
  -	 Nice to have :  visualize this on a diagram  = requires pan/zoom/layering features


The SCD describes the binding (mapping) between the required LNs per equipment/function
  -	Assign / unassign / reassign LNs from IEDs to equipment
  -	Per IED, show/ edit data set definitions
  -	Per IED, show / edit report control block definitions


Export functions
  -	Export SCD in appropriate version for clients
  -	Nice-to-have: export subset per IED in appropriate version (i.e. ICD + goose subscription information)/(IEC 61850-6 says this is an IED configurator function)

IEC 61850-6 Table G.2 – System configurator conformance statement  has three pages of function headings some of which are complex
