| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **CID** | **Configured IED Description**. This SCL file contains the device-specific data for the configuration of an IED. |
|**ICD** | **IED Capability Description**. This SCL file contains the description of the complete capabilities of an IED as well as the associated logical nodes and data types. |
|**IID** | **Instantiated IED Description**. This SCL file contains the instantiated configuration of an IED returned by an IED configurator. |
|**SCD**| **System Configuration Description**. This SCL file contains the description of the complete substation automation system (single line diagram and logical node representation of functionalities, communication network, IED functions and configurations). |
|**SCL**| The **System Configuration description Language** is the language specified by the IEC 61850 standard for the configuration of devices in the power substation. It aims at ensuring the functional interoperability between equipment from a system perspective by defining object models for the devices and for their interrelated functions. SCL is defined in IEC 61850 Part 6. It includes several types of files: SSD, SCD, ICD, CID, IID, SED. *(cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substation_Configuration_Language)* |
|**SED**| **System Exchange Description**. This SCL file contains the description of the communication interface between two systems (two substations). |
|**SSD**| **System Specification Description**. This SCL file contains the description of the substation automation system based on a single line diagram and a logical node representation of functionalities. |
