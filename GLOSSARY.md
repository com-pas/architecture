# Glossary

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **CID** | **Configured IED Description**. This SCL file contains the device-specific data for the configuration of an IED. |
|**ICD** | **IED Capability Description**. This SCL file contains the description of the complete capabilities of an IED as well as the associated logical nodes and data types. |
|**IID** | **Instantiated IED Description**. This SCL file contains the instantiated configuration of an IED returned by an IED configurator. |
|**ISD** | **IED Specification Description**. The ISD file is the formal specification of IEDs or IED Types that the utility imposes to the IED vendor as part of the frame agreement. By associating the ISD Files with the specification documents a device dependent specification can be created. |
|**SCD**| **System Configuration Description**. This SCL file contains the description of the complete substation automation system (single line diagram and logical node representation of functionalities, communication network, IED functions and configurations). |
|**SED**| **System Exchange Description**. This SCL file is to be exchanged between system configurators of different projects. It describes the interfaces of one project to be used by another project, and at re-import the additionally engineered interface connections between the projects.|
|**SCL**| The **System Configuration description Language** is the language specified by the IEC 61850 standard for the configuration of devices in the power substation. It aims at ensuring the functional interoperability between equipment from a system perspective by defining object models for the devices and for their interrelated functions. SCL is defined in IEC 61850 Part 6. It includes several types of files: SSD, SCD, ICD, CID, IID, SED. *(cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substation_Configuration_Language)* |
|**SED**| **System Exchange Description**. This SCL file contains the description of the communication interface between two systems (two substations). |
|**SSD**| **System Specification Description**. This SCL file contains the description of the substation automation system based on a single line diagram and a logical node representation of functionalities. |
